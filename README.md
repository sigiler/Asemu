# Asemu

A simple emulator in C++ built around a custom designed 24 bits cpu.

Made for practising the implementation of an emulator of a custom virtual computer.
Additionally playing with git and improve C++ programming skills.
Might transform into some toy project like a virtual console game, 
 proof of concept for a minimal general operating system or 
 simulate networked hacking of virtual computers.

Documentation will come when the design is stable.

## Currently working

* instruction set
* keyboard input
* video and audio output

## Future work

* memory protection
* multiple cores
* networking
* more emulated hardware
* may have some optimizations
* possibility of Qt front-end

## Dependencies

* SDL2
