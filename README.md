# Asemu

A simple emulator in C++ built around a custom designed 24 bits cpu.

Made as a practise for possibly programming an emulator of some real computer,
 transform into some toy project like a virtual console game
 or showcase a minimal operating system.

Documentation is too incomplete and outdated to be worth sharing.

## Currently working

* instruction set
* keyboard input
* video and audio output

## Future ideas

* multiple cores
* memory protection
* more emulated hardware
* Qt frontend
