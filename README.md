# Asemu

A simple emulator in C++ built around a custom designed 24 bits cpu.

Made for practising the implementation of an emulator for a virtual computer.
Additionally playing with git and improve C++ programming skills.
Might transform into some toy project like a virtual console game,
 proof of concept for a minimal general operating system or 
 simulate hacking in networked virtual computers.

Documentation will come when the design is stable.

## Currently working

* instruction set interpreted at 16 MHz
* keyboard input
* video and audio output

## Future work

* memory protection
* privilege mode
* multiple cores running in threads
* more emulated hardware
* more optimizations
* networking
* nice Qt front-end

## Dependencies

* SDL2
