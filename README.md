# Asemu

A simple emulator in C++ built around a custom designed 24bit cpu.

Made as a practise for possibly coding an emulator for some real device
 or transform into some fun project like a virtual console game or minimal OS.

Documentation is incomplete and outdated laying around in a spreadsheet.
