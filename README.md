# Asemu

A simple emulator in C++ built around a custom designed 24 bits cpu.

Made as a practise for possibly programming an emulator of some real computer,
 transform into some toy project like a virtual console game
 or showcase a minimal operating system.

Documentation will come when the design is stable.

## Currently working

* instruction set
* keyboard input
* video and audio output

## Future work

* memory protection
* multiple cores
* more emulated hardware
* may have some optimizations
* possibility of Qt frontend

## Dependencies

* SDL2
